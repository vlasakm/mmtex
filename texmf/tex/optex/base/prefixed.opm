\sec[prefixed] Concept of namespaces of control sequences

\secc Prefixing internal control sequences

All control sequences used in \OpTeX/ are used and defined with `_` prefix.
The user can be sure that when he/she does `\def\foo` then neither internal macros of
\OpTeX/ nor \TeX/ primitives will be damaged. For example
`\def\if{...}` will not damage macros because \OpTeX/'s macros
are using `\_if` instead of `\if`.

All \TeX/ primitives are initialized with two representative control
sequences: `\word` and `\_word`, for example `\hbox` and `\_hbox`.
The first alternative is reserved for users or such control sequences
can be re-defined by a user.

\OpTeX/ sets the character `_` as letter, so it can be used in
control sequences. When a control sequence begins with this character
then it means that it is a primitive or it is used in \OpTeX/ macros as
internal. User can redefine such prefixed control sequence only
if he/she explicitly knows what happens.

We never change catcode of `_`, so internal macros can be
redefined by user without problems if it is desired. We don't need
something like `\makeatletter` from \LaTeX/.

\OpTeX/ defines all new macros as prefixed. For public usage of such macros,
we need to set their non-prefixed versions. This is done by

\begtt \catcode`\<=13
\public <list of control sequences> ;
\endtt

For example \^`\public`` \foo \bar ;` does `\let\foo=\_foo`, `\let\bar=\_bar`.

At the end of each code segment in \OpTeX/, the `\_public` macro is used. You
can see which macros are defined for public usage in that code segment.

The macro \^`\private` does the reverse job of `\public` with the same syntax.
For example `\private \foo \bar ;` does `\let\_foo=\foo`, `\let\_bar=\bar`.
This should be used when an unprefixed variant of a control sequence is declared
already but we need the prefixed variant too.

In this documentation: if both variants of a control sequence are declared
(prefixed and unprefixed), then the accompanying text mentions only
the unprefixed variant. The code typically defines the prefixed variant
and then the \^`\public` (or `\_public`) macro is used.

\secc[user-ns] Namespace of control sequences for users

Users can (re)define or (re)declare any control sequence with a name without any `_`.
This does not make any problem in internal \OpTeX/ macros.\fnote
{The token `\par` is in user name space too from \OpTeX/ 1.04+ and
Lua\TeX/ 1.14, see also the end of section~\ref[others].}

User can define or declare control sequences with `_` character, for
example `\my_control_sequence`, but with the following exceptions:

\begitems
* Control sequences which begin with `_` are reserved for \TeX/ primitives,
  \OpTeX/ internal macros and packages internal macros.
* Multiletter control sequences in the form
  `\<word>_` or `\<word>_<one-letter>`, where
  <word> is a sequence of letters, are inaccessible, because they
  are interpreted as `\<word>` followed by `_` or as `\<word>` followed by
  `_<one-letter>`. This is important for writing math, for example:
\begtt  \adef-{_}
  \int-a^b    ... is interpreted as \int _a^b
  \max-M      ... is interpreted as \max _M
  \alpha-{ij} ... is interpreted as \alpha _{ij}
\endtt
  This feature is implemented using Lua code at input processor level, see
  the section~\ref[math-macros] for more details. You can deactivate this feature by
  \^`\mathsboff`. After this, you can still write
  `$`$\int$`_a^b$` (Unicode) or `$\int _a^b$` % $âˆ«_a^b$ (Unicode) or $\int _a^b$
  without problems but `\int``_a^b` yields to undefined control sequence
  `\int``_a`. You can activate this feature again by \^`\mathsbon`. The
  effect will take shape from next line read from input file.
* Control sequences in the form `\_<pkg>_<word>` is intended for package
  writers as internal macros for a package with `<pkg>` identifier,
  see section~\ref[pkg-namespace].
\enditems

The single-letter control sequences like `\%`, `\$`, `\^` etc. are not used
in internal macros. Users can redefine them, but (of course) some classical
features can be lost (printing percent character by `\%` for example).

\secc Macro files syntax

Segments of \OpTeX/ macros or external macro packages
are stored in files with `.opm` extension
(means OPtex Macros). Your local macros should be in a normal `*.tex` file.

The code in macro files starts by \^`\_codedecl` and ends by \^`\_endcode`.
The \^`\_endcode` is equivalent for `\endinput`, so documentation can follow.
The \^`\_codedecl` has syntax:

\begtt \catcode`<=13 \adef!{\string}
\_codedecl \sequence {<short title> !<<version>>}
\endtt

If the mentioned `\sequence` is undefined then \^`\_codedecl` prints the message
\begtt  \catcode`<=13 \adef!{\string}
@:[<file name>] <short title> !<<version>>
\endtt
to the log file and \TeX/ continues with reading the following macros.
If the `\sequence` is defined, then \^`\_codedecl` acts like
`\endinput`: this protects from reading the file twice. We suppose, that
`\sequence` is defined in the macro file.

It is possible to use the \^`\_doc` ... \^`\_cod` pair between the macro
definitions. The documentation text should be here.
It is ignored when macros are read.

The \^`\_doc` ... \^`\_cod` parts can be printed after \^`\load[doc]`
using \~`\printdoc` macro, see section~\ref[doc].
If you have created a documented macro file `pkgname.opm` then you can
put macros for creating your documentation between
first pair of \^`\_doc` ... \^`\_cod` used after \^`\_endcode`.
These macros should \^`\load[doc]` and must be finished by \^`\bye`.
Then you have code+documentation together in a single file and
user can generate the documentation of our package by
\^`\docgen` used at command line:
\begtt
optex -jobname pkgname-doc '\docgen pkgname'
\endtt
Example of a  \^`\_doc` ... \^`\_cod` code used for creating the
documentation using \^`\docgen` can be found in the `math.opm` file. You can see
\ulink[https://petr.olsak.net/ftp/olsak/optex/math-doc.pdf]{its documentation}, especially
\ulink[https://petr.olsak.net/ftp/olsak/optex/math-doc.pdf\#ref:pkgtemplate]
{section about creating packages}.

\secc[pkg-namespace] Name spaces for package writers

Package writer should use internal names in the form `\_<pgk>_<sequence>`,
where `<pkg>` is a package label. For example:
`\_qr_utfstring` from `qrcode.opm` package.

The package writer does not need to write repeatedly `\_pkg_foo` `\_pkg_bar`
etc.\ again and again in the macro file.\fnote
{We have not adopted the idea from expl3 language:)}
When the \^`\_namespace` `{<pkg>}`
is declared at the beginning of the macro file then all occurrences of
`\.foo` will be replaced by `\_<pkg>_foo` at the input processor level.
The macro writer can write (and backward can read his/her code) simply with
`\.foo`, `\.bar` control sequences and `\_<pkg>_foo`, `\_<pkg>_bar`
control sequences are processed internally.
The scope of the \^`\_namespace` command ends at the \^`\_endnamespace` command
or when another \^`\_namespace` is used. This command checks
if the same package label is not declared by the \^`\_namespace` twice.

\^`\_nspublic` `<list of sequences> ;`
does `\let\foo = \_<pkg>_foo` for each given sequence when
\^`\_namespace{<pkg>}` is declared. Moreover, it prints a warning if `\foo` is
defined already. The \^`\_nsprivate` macro does reverse
operation to it without warnings. Example: you can define `\def\.macro{...}` and then
set it to the user name space by `\_nspublic \macro;`.

It could happen that a package writer needs to declare a control sequence
(say `\foo`) directly without setting it in `\_<pkg>_foo` name space
followed by using \^`\_nspublic`. The \^`\newpublic` prefix should be used in this
case, for example `\_newpublic\_def\foo` or `\_newpublic\_chardef\foo` or
`\_newpublic{\_long\_def}\foo`. The \^`\newpublic``<do>\<sequence>` prints
a warning if the declared `\<sequence>` is defined already and then runs
`<do>\<sequence>`. The reason of the warning is the same as when
\^`\_nspublic` warns about doing re-declaration of control sequences already
declared.

Don't load other packages (which are using their own namespace) inside your
namespace. Do load them before your \^`\_namespace`~`{<pkg>}` is
initialized. Or close your namespace by \^`\_endnamespace` and open it again
(after other packages are loaded) by \^`\_resetnamespace`~`{<pkg>}`.

If the package writer needs to declare a control
sequence by \^`\newif`, then there is an exception of the rule described above. Use
\^`\_newifi\_if<pkg>_bar`, for example `\_newifi\_ifqr_incorner`.
Then the control sequences `\_qr_incornertrue` and
`\_qr_incornerfalse` can be used (or the sequences `\.incornertrue`
and `\.incornerfalse` when `\_namespace{qr}` is used).


\secc Summary about rules for external macro files published for \OpTeX/

If you are writing a macro file that is intended to be published for
\OpTeX/, then you are greatly welcome. You should follow these rules:

\begitems
* Don't use control sequences from the user namespace in the macro
  bodies if there is no explicit and documented reason to do this.
* Don't declare control sequences in the user namespace if there are no
  explicit and documented reasons to do this.
* Use control sequences from \OpTeX/ and primitive namespace
  in read-only mode, if there is not an explicit and documented reason to
  redefine them.
* Use `\_<pkg>_<name>` for your internal macros or `\.<name>` if the
  \^`\_namespace{<pkg>}` is declared. See section~\ref[pkg-namespace].
* Use \^`\load` (or better: `\_load`) for loading more external macros
  if you need them. Don't use `\_input` explicitly in such cases.
  The reason is: the external macro file is not loaded
  twice if another macro or the user needs it explicitly too.
* Use \^`\_codedecl` as your first command in the macro file and
  \^`\_endcode` to close the text of macros.
* Use \^`\_doc` ... \^`\_cod` pairs for documenting the code pieces.
* You can write more documentation after the \^`\_endcode` command.
* The \OpTeX/ catcodes are set when \^`\load` your package (i.e. plain \TeX/
  catcodes plus catcode of `_` is 11). If a catcode is changed during
  loading your package then it is forgot because \^`\load` returns to catcodes
  used before loading package. If you want to offer a catcode changing for
  users then insert it to a macro which can be used after loading.
\enditems

If the macro file accepts these recommendations then it should be
named by `<filename>.opm` where `<filename>` differs from file names
used directly in \OpTeX/ and from other published macros.
This extension `.opm` has precedence before `.tex` when
the \^`\load` macro is used.

The `qrcode.opm` is the first example of how an external macro file for \OpTeX/
can look like.
