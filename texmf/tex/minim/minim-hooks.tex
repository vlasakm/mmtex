% The purpose of this module is allowing arbitrary code be run at specific 
% places. I have not yet included it in the manual, because I still am a bit 
% unsure about the details of the implementation.
%
% The first thing done here is inserting a callback into \shipout (and 
% tex.shipout) mirroring finish_pdf, allowing last-minute manipulation before 
% the pdf code will be assembled.
%
% The second feature is adding things to the beginning of a paragraph without 
% (seemingly) disturbing \everypar, and also adding things to the next 
% paragraph only.
%
% Both features are implemented in a way that is repeatable and should coexist 
% peacefully with other packages doing something of the same. But please let me 
% know if you run into any problems.
